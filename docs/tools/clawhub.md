# LittleBabyHub

LittleBabyHub is the public registry for **LittleBaby skills and plugins**.

- Use native `littlebaby` commands to search/install/update skills and install
  plugins from LittleBabyHub.
- Use the separate `littlebabyhub` CLI when you need registry auth, publish, delete,
  undelete, or sync workflows.

## Native LittleBaby flows

Skills:

```bash
littlebaby skills search "calendar"
littlebaby skills install <skill-slug>
littlebaby skills update --all
```

Plugins:

```bash
littlebaby plugins install littlebabyhub:<package>
littlebaby plugins update --all
```

Bare npm-safe plugin specs are also tried against LittleBabyHub before npm:

```bash
littlebaby plugins install littlebaby-codex-app-server
```

Native `littlebaby` commands install into your active workspace and persist source
metadata so later `update` calls can stay on LittleBabyHub.

Plugin installs validate advertised `pluginApi` and `minGatewayVersion`
compatibility before archive install runs, so incompatible hosts fail closed
early instead of partially installing the package.

`littlebaby plugins install littlebabyhub:...` only accepts installable plugin families.
If a LittleBabyHub package is actually a skill, LittleBaby stops and points you at
`littlebaby skills install <slug>` instead.

## What LittleBabyHub is

- A public registry for LittleBaby skills and plugins.
- A versioned store of skill bundles and metadata.
- A discovery surface for search, tags, and usage signals.

## How it works

1. A user publishes a skill bundle (files + metadata).
2. LittleBabyHub stores the bundle, parses metadata, and assigns a version.
3. The registry indexes the skill for search and discovery.
4. Users browse, download, and install skills in LittleBaby.

## What you can do

- Publish new skills and new versions of existing skills.
- Discover skills by name, tags, or search.
- Download skill bundles and inspect their files.
- Report skills that are abusive or unsafe.
- If you are a moderator, hide, unhide, delete, or ban.

## Who this is for (beginner-friendly)

If you want to add new capabilities to your LittleBaby agent, LittleBabyHub is the easiest way to find and install skills. You do not need to know how the backend works. You can:

- Search for skills by plain language.
- Install a skill into your workspace.
- Update skills later with one command.
- Back up your own skills by publishing them.

## Quick start (non-technical)

1. Search for something you need:
   - `littlebaby skills search "calendar"`
2. Install a skill:
   - `littlebaby skills install <skill-slug>`
3. Start a new LittleBaby session so it picks up the new skill.
4. If you want to publish or manage registry auth, install the separate
   `littlebabyhub` CLI too.

## Install the LittleBabyHub CLI

You only need this for registry-authenticated workflows such as publish/sync:

```bash
npm i -g littlebabyhub
```

```bash
pnpm add -g littlebabyhub
```

## How it fits into LittleBaby

Native `littlebaby skills install` installs into the active workspace `skills/`
directory. `littlebaby plugins install littlebabyhub:...` records a normal managed
plugin install plus LittleBabyHub source metadata for updates.

Anonymous LittleBabyHub plugin installs also fail closed for private packages.
Community or other non-official channels can still install, but LittleBaby warns
so operators can review source and verification before enabling them.

The separate `littlebabyhub` CLI also installs skills into `./skills` under your
current working directory. If an LittleBaby workspace is configured, `littlebabyhub`
falls back to that workspace unless you override `--workdir` (or
`LITTLEBABYHUB_WORKDIR`). LittleBaby loads workspace skills from `<workspace>/skills`
and will pick them up in the **next** session. If you already use
`~/.littlebaby/skills` or bundled skills, workspace skills take precedence.

For more detail on how skills are loaded, shared, and gated, see
[Skills](/tools/skills).

## Skill system overview

A skill is a versioned bundle of files that teaches LittleBaby how to perform a
specific task. Each publish creates a new version, and the registry keeps a
history of versions so users can audit changes.

A typical skill includes:

- A `SKILL.md` file with the primary description and usage.
- Optional configs, scripts, or supporting files used by the skill.
- Metadata such as tags, summary, and install requirements.

LittleBabyHub uses metadata to power discovery and safely expose skill capabilities.
The registry also tracks usage signals (such as stars and downloads) to improve
ranking and visibility.

## What the service provides (features)

- **Public browsing** of skills and their `SKILL.md` content.
- **Search** powered by embeddings (vector search), not just keywords.
- **Versioning** with semver, changelogs, and tags (including `latest`).
- **Downloads** as a zip per version.
- **Stars and comments** for community feedback.
- **Moderation** hooks for approvals and audits.
- **CLI-friendly API** for automation and scripting.

## Security and moderation

LittleBabyHub is open by default. Anyone can upload skills, but a GitHub account must
be at least one week old to publish. This helps slow down abuse without blocking
legitimate contributors.

Reporting and moderation:

- Any signed in user can report a skill.
- Report reasons are required and recorded.
- Each user can have up to 20 active reports at a time.
- Skills with more than 3 unique reports are auto hidden by default.
- Moderators can view hidden skills, unhide them, delete them, or ban users.
- Abusing the report feature can result in account bans.

Interested in becoming a moderator? Ask in the LittleBaby Discord and contact a
moderator or maintainer.

## Common workflows for agents

### Search for skills

```bash
littlebabyhub search "postgres backups"
```

### Download new skills

```bash
littlebabyhub install my-skill-pack
```

### Update installed skills

```bash
littlebabyhub update --all
```

### Back up your skills (publish or sync)

For a single skill folder:

```bash
littlebabyhub skill publish ./my-skill --slug my-skill --name "My Skill" --version 1.0.0 --tags latest
```

To scan and back up many skills at once:

```bash
littlebabyhub sync --all
```

### Publish a plugin from GitHub

```bash
littlebabyhub package publish your-org/your-plugin --dry-run
littlebabyhub package publish your-org/your-plugin
littlebabyhub package publish your-org/your-plugin@v1.0.0
littlebabyhub package publish https://github.com/your-org/your-plugin
```

Code plugins must include the required LittleBaby metadata in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@myorg/littlebaby-my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "littlebaby": {
    "extensions": ["./index.ts"],
    "compat": {
      "pluginApi": ">=2026.3.24-beta.2",
      "minGatewayVersion": "2026.3.24-beta.2"
    },
    "build": {
      "littlebabyVersion": "2026.3.24-beta.2",
      "pluginSdkVersion": "2026.3.24-beta.2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced details (technical)

### Versioning and tags

- Each publish creates a new **semver** `SkillVersion`.
- Tags (like `latest`) point to a version; moving tags lets you roll back.
- Changelogs are attached per version and can be empty when syncing or publishing updates.

### Local changes vs registry versions

Updates compare the local skill contents to registry versions using a content hash. If local files do not match any published version, the CLI asks before overwriting (or requires `--force` in non-interactive runs).

### Sync scanning and fallback roots

`littlebabyhub sync` scans your current workdir first. If no skills are found, it falls back to known legacy locations (for example `~/littlebaby/skills` and `~/.littlebaby/skills`). This is designed to find older skill installs without extra flags.

### Storage and lockfile

- Installed skills are recorded in `.littlebabyhub/lock.json` under your workdir.
- Auth tokens are stored in the LittleBabyHub CLI config file (override via `LITTLEBABYHUB_CONFIG_PATH`).

### Telemetry (install counts)

When you run `littlebabyhub sync` while logged in, the CLI sends a minimal snapshot to compute install counts. You can disable this entirely:

```bash
export LITTLEBABYHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

## Environment variables

- `LITTLEBABYHUB_SITE`: Override the site URL.
- `LITTLEBABYHUB_REGISTRY`: Override the registry API URL.
- `LITTLEBABYHUB_CONFIG_PATH`: Override where the CLI stores the token/config.
- `LITTLEBABYHUB_WORKDIR`: Override the default workdir.
- `LITTLEBABYHUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`: Disable telemetry on `sync`.
